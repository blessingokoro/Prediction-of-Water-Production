STATEMENT OF PROBLEM   
In petroleum fields, one of the most important aspect of production is finding a 
way to optimize production in a cost- effective manner and to save time. 
Production and handling of produced water usually define the hydrocarbon 
reserve and the economic lifetime of the wells in the field therefore predicting 
and evaluating this water production is important. The work of an operator is to 
devise optimal operating strategies to achieve these goals. This project will 
develop a prediction model that will ease and automate the decision making of 
field operators. 

AIM OF STUDY   
To predict water production using an artificial intelligent approach. The volve 
field as CASE STUDY. 

OBJECTIVES  
In order to achieve the above set goals, the following objectives will be 
considered:   
1. Studying the water production problems in the Niger Delta and other 
regions. 
2. Developing a model that effectively predict water production. 
3. Optimizing the model for better performance and reliability. 
4. Prediction of water production using different Machine Learning models.

SIGNIFICANCE  
During the life- time of a producing well, production may gradually start to 
decline due to increase in water cut as the well is being depleted and other 
factors that affect production. This often result to the use of different well 
intervention method which is usually expensive and takes time. With Machine 
learning algorithm, one can be able to discover new information and identify 
patterns that will enable improvement of production by developing a model for 
the prediction of water production in a well. 

SCOPE OF STUDY   
The focus on this project was to apply a Machine learning approach for 
prediction of water production. Different machine learning algorithms will be 
deployed on production data from Volve Field. The best is selected and the 
developed model will be consequently fine-tuned through hyper 
parameterization of controlled variables. These variables include; flowrate, 
gauge sizes, oil, water and gas production, GOR, BHFP, choke sizes, wellhead 
temperature and pressure, tubing sizes.
